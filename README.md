How to use
----------

There are two ways to use QZXLSReader:

1) The default way:

- Drag and drop the .framework.
- Add libiconv.dylib to your project.

2) The custom way:

- Change anything you want from the project.
- Compile this project.
- Fix any warnings that might come up (I had to do some dancing with the structs to make it work without exposing libxls).
