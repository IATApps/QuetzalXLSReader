QuetzalXLSReader
================

QZXLSReader is a library that makes it very easy to extract information from an XLS file. It is a very simple library that is based off libxls and DHlibXLS. It may not be as complete as either, but it can get the job done in a very simple manner.

Note: I haven't tried it, but I believe it cannot open XLSX or XLSM files.

How to use
----------

There are two ways to use QZXLSReader:

1) The default way:

- Drag and drop the .framework.
- Add libiconv.dylib to your project.

2) The custom way:

- Change anything you want from the project.
- Compile this project.
- Fix any warnings that might come up (I had to do some dancing with the structs to make it work without exposing libxls).
- Add libiconv.dylib to your project.

Once you have the framework in your project and it's building correctly, you can start by calling:

    QZWorkbook *excelReader = [[QZWorkbook alloc] initWithContentsOfXLS:xlsFileURL];

This loads the workbook into memory. Now all you have to do is open any worksheet and start browsing the contents.

```
QZWorkSheet *firstWorkSheet = excelReader.workSheets.firstObject;
[firstWorkSheet open];

NSLog(@"%@", firstWorkSheet.rows.firstObject)
```

Once you're done, you can close either the worksheet you were working on or the whole workbook.

FAQ
---

I'm running into an error in QZCell.h. How do I fix that?
- Short answer:
 
Change:

    - (id)initWithContent:(xlsCell *)cell;

to

    - (id)initWithContent:(struct xlsCell *)cell;

- Long answer: 

I'm not sure what's going on, since the compiler complains only with a newly built library (and it doesn't complain while building). Once built, it complains that it doesn't know what an xlsCell is, so you have to define it (again) as a struct.
